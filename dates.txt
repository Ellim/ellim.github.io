Today is the first day of this year long gift idea.

Yesterday was Christmas and it was amazing. 
We had a bit of a rough start to the day with Ronan trying to open her Santa presents as soon as she got up.
I wish I hadn't yelled at her and had kept myself more under control. 
I'll attribute it to not enough sleep the night before but this isn't a valid excuse to yell on Christmas.
I'm glad that today we got to simply hang out and recover from the hectic day yesterday. I loved seeing the girls putting their LEGO's together and how excited Ronan was to play shop with you.
It is so rewarding to be able to experience these days together as a family, and I am so grateful for you and the girls and all you do for me.

Thank you for letting me be myself every day, and allowing me time to recover when I need it.

Lazy Sunday (#1)

We didn't do much again today aside from a bit of cleaning but I need to say thank you for doing the dishes and making us food. 
You have now made lunch and dinner for us every day this year and I need to work on making sure I pull more of my own weight in chores and cooking.
I stayed up super late programming this clicker game tonight. You've inspired me to continue working on it and nothing has ever motivated me more to want to finish something than you being interested in what I was making.

Thank you for believing in me and always being my inspiration.

Back to work.

Today we got up together and dropped the kids off at all day care. 
This was due to winter break still going on and both of us having work. 
We didn't have much in the way of breakfast foods to prepare but you made due with PBJ and some cereal. 
I would love if we were always getting up in the mornings together as it's just that much more time I get to see you each day.
I need to work on getting myself up in time to help prepare breakfasts/lunches so it doesn't land on you entirely.
